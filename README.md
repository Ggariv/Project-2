# The Food Tracker

Everyone is always looking to try something new. At internet, you can search for new recipes all over the world and try to cook it by your own.
However, as many food platforms offer their multiple dishes to the users, users would like to submit their own recipe to a platform so that other users would try new dishes from new sources. 

The Food Tracker has evolved! Now we're allowing users to become members of our community! 
Users can now log in and not only request for new recipe data, but will also have the option of uploading their own recipes by fulfilling the required criteria.

Writing about tech can be just as important as making it. Developers spend plenty of time creating new applications and debugging existing codebases, but most developers also spend at least some of their time reading and writing about technical concepts, recent advancements, and new technologies. A simple Google search for any concept covered in this course returns thousands of think pieces and tutorials from developers of all skill levels!
